# Constant keep-alive, subscribed to redis
# Claim replay from pool to prevent parsing from multiple pod instances
# Download replay from spaces & parse
# Upload parsed data into database
#
# Goals of this project:
# - Good logging. Running the analysis thousands of times acrross many instances will produce funky stuff
# - Performance isn't a big deal, but keep loops to a minimal
# - Clean architecture, with support for adding testing in the future
